# Setting Up Your Sina Weibo Development Environment #

No matter which operating system you are using, you will need essentially the same set of tools:

  * [Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK)](JDK.md)

  * [The Eclipse Integrated Development Environment](Eclipse.md)

  * [The Android Software Developer's Kit (SDK)](AndroidSDK.md)

  * [A special Eclipse plugin: the Android Developer Tool (ADT)](ADT.md)

  * [A subversion plugin for Eclipse: Subclipse](Subclipse.md)

  * [The Sina Weibo Developer's Kit (SDK)](SinaWeiboSDK.md)

After setting up the development environment, you can try [debugging the samples from Sina Weibo SDK](DebugSamples.md) to ramp up.
