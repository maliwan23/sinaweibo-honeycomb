# Install the Android Plugin (ADT) #

  * Start Eclipse, from the menu bar, select "Help -> Install New Software..."

  * In the Install dialog, click on "Add…" An "Add Repository" dialog pops up. Enter a name for the plugin ("Android Plugin" will do), and the URL for updates: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse. Click "OK".

  * The new site should now appear in the list of sites on the Install dialog.

  * In the Search Results dialog, select the checkbox for "Developer Tools" and click "Next".

  * Check Install Details and click “Next”.

  * The license agreement for the plugin appears. Read it, and if you agree, select "Accept terms of the license agreement" and click "Next". Click "Finish".

  * If you get a warning that the plugin is not signed, choose to install it anyway by clicking "Install All."

  * Restart Eclipse.

  * After Eclipse restarts, you need to tell it where the SDK is located. From the menu bar, select "Window -> Preferences". In the Preferences dialog, select "Android" in the left hand column.

  * Use the "Browse" button to navigate to the place you installed the Android SDK, and click on "Apply", then on "OK".
