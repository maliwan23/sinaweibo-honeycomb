We are intending to develop a large screen android application towards social networking. Sinaweibo is a traditional social platform marked by Sina.com. This kind of application shares the TV information mainly based on text. We want to explore some new social scenarios based on video and image sharing.

This project is open-source based. Any contribution is appreciated!
